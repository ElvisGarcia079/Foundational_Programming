#Initializing a Variable

#With Python it is Simple. You just need: 
'''
1. The Variable Name
2. The Assignment Operator
3. The Value
'''

#The Value Could Be Any Data Type: 

#1. A String
progLanguage = "Python"

#2. A Number
age = 28

#3. A Boolean
isCoding = True

#You can check the values by using Python's Print Method with the variable name inside
print(progLanguage)
print(age)
print(isCoding)

#You can also check the type of the data by using the Python Type Method: 
type(progLanguage)
type(age)
type(isCoding)

#If you would like to see the result of the Method Type, you will need to wrap it within the method Print
print(type(progLanguage))
print(type(age))
print(type(isCoding))
