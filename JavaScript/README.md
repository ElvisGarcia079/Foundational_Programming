# Simple Variables in JavaScript

Variables in JavaScript only require 5 things: 
* The Keyword `let` or `var`. `let` is better.
* The Variable Name
* The Assignment Operator
* The Variable Value
* A Semicolon at the End

The Value of the Variable can be any of the Primitive Data Types: 
* `Strings`
* `Numbers`
* `Booleans`

It can also be: 
* `null`
* `undefined`

Whenever you want to check the value of your variables you can use the Python Print Method:
* `console.log()`

Whenever you want to check the data type of your variable, you can use the following Python Method: 
* `typeof()`

If you would like to see the result of the Data Type on the console or output screen, you will have to wrap the return value of the `typeof()` method within the parentheses of the `console.log()` method as follows: 
* `console.log(typeof())`

You can also store the reference to your `typeof()` method in a variable first. Then log to the console the value of that reference using `console.log()` as follows: 
* `let reference = typeof(someVariable);`
* `console.log(reference);`
