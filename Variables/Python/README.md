# Simple Variables in Python

Variables in Python only require 3 things: 
* The Variable Name
* The Assignment Operator
* The Variable Value

The Value of the Variable can be any of the Primitive Data Types: 
* `Strings`
* `Numbers`
* `Booleans`

Whenever you want to check the value of your variables you can use the Python Print Method:
* `print()`

Whenever you want to check the data type of your variable, you can use the following Python Method: 
* `type()`

If you would like to see the result of the Data Type on the console or output screen, you will have to wrap the return value of the `type()` method within the parentheses of the `print()` method as follows: 
* `print(type())`

You can also store the reference to your `type()` method in a variable first. Then print the value of that reference using `print()` as follows: 
* `reference = type(someVariable);`
* `print(reference);`

## Happy Coding!
