        //We will be working with String, Integer, and Boolean Variables.

        //To Declare Variables, we will need the following:
        /* 
            1. The Keyword String, int, or boolean
                a. If the value is a String, you'll use the keyword String
                b. If the value is a Whole Number, you'll use the keyword int
                c. If the value is a Boolean, you'll use the keyword boolean
            2. A Variable Name
            3. The Assignment Operator
            4. The Value
            5. A Semi Colon
        */
